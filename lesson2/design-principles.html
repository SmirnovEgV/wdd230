        <h3>Visual Hierarcy</h3>
        <p>Church of Jesus Christ of LDS</p>
        <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng">churchofjesuschrist.org</a>
        <img src="images/visual hierarchy.png" alt="Churck of Jesus Christ home page mob view">
        <p>I choose church website as example of Visual hierarchy. 
            According to one of many websites: Visual hierarchy is
            the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance.
            The first thing you see when visiting Church site is (for now)
            invitation to come and listen to the living prophets voice.
            Then the elements that follow after explain beliefs that members
            of the Church have and a tool to find Church building near you and act. 
            These are in my opinion a good example of Visual hierarchy because
            the first things people see is the most important one.</p>

        <h3>Alignment</h3>
        <p>Amazon</p>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">amazon.com</a>
        <img src="images/alignment.png" alt="Amazone home page mob view">
        <p>Amazon webpage is a good exampe of alignment design principle it
            has a bunch of different boxes with different things and 
            in order to make sense it should be properly aligned. A lot, if not all, 
            boxes with products are in their own distinct place which makes it
            easier to find and see. Product boxes are not overshadowed by
            eachother and most of them are grouped by their departmens.  </p>

        <h3>Contrasts</h3>
        <p>Pluralsight</p>
        <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">pluralsight.com</a>
        <img src="images/contasts.png" alt="Pluralsight home page mob view">
        <p>Pluralsight webpage is contrast example that I choose to use. It
            uses multiple colors that greatly interact with each other and 
            look great in general. All elements have pleasant look and easy to read.
            Text size and color make the same pleasant impression.
            Usage of darker colors from a start means that there are no needs
            in a light theme. The overall menu, search bar, help and notifications 
            are easily seen and good looking as well as other functionality.</p>
